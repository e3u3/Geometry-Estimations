# Geometry Estimation

UCSD CSE 252B course projects, implementing classical geometry estimation algorithms using python.

Typically, this project includes several multi-view geometry estimation task: Camera Projection Matrix Estimation, Camera Pose Estimation, Planar Projective Transformation Estimation and Fundamental Matrix Estimation.
